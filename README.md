# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Explore Data from API's and build a statistical model
Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources to build a comprehensive dataset.
Statistical Modelling: Apply statistical models to analyze the data 
## Process
Part 1: Data Collection

Identify Data Sources:

Determine the primary data sources for the project, including Foursquare and Yelp.

Access API Documentation:

Review the API documentation of Foursquare and Yelp to understand data retrieval methods and endpoints.

API Requests:

Make API requests to Foursquare and Yelp to gather relevant data, such as business details, user reviews, and location information.

Data Cleaning:

Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
Data Integration: Combining data from diverse sources and formats posed challenges in terms of data cleaning and integration.

Data Quality: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the collected data was a continuous effort. Cleaning noisy data was a time-consuming task.

## Future Goals
